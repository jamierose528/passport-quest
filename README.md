# passport-quest

Having caught the travel bug, I would like to plan my trip with  activities, transportation, live-count budget, diary entries and photos.

## Description

When the user first opens the app, they are brough to a search page, with sign in options in the navbar. If the user does not wish to create an account and just want to look up blog posts via username, country, or city, they can use the search bar. If they want to create an account, they can go into the sign in tab and type in they're information!

Once you have an account, your public profile will look like a passport, with each page being a trip that you've taken. When a visitor clicks on an individual page, it will take them to that trip's blog posts. 

## Criteria
It is done when a user must login to create:
- Create new blog entries
- Access budget tracker
- Upload photos/videos
- Travel route/transportation
It is done when a visitor can:
- Access existing blogs by city/food 
It is done when all routes connect and the user is given the information requested successfully.
